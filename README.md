A beamer theme that mimics KTH's existing powerpoint template. 
Note that it is in no way an official template, and also not the only template
available on github and other places.

I attempt to use beamercolorboxes and their features instead of for example
textpos.

latex3 code is used for a couple of macros, such as placing footnotes.
